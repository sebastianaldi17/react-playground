# React Playground 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Make sure to install `react-router-dom` using npm, because it is not bundled with react (AFAIK). The code demonstrates routing with `react-router-dom`, clock that updates every second (using function instead of class), and the hello world of react applications: Todo app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
